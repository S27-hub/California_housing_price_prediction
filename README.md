# California Housing Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This repository contains a machine learning model to predict California housing prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and more. The dataset used in this project is derived from publicly available California housing data, which includes demographic, geographic, and economic factors affecting real estate prices.

# Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates the median house values in California's districts, using machine learning techniques such as:

# Linear Regression: 
A baseline model to understand the relationship between house features and price.

# Random Forest: 
To improve accuracy by reducing overfitting and increasing model robustness.

The model is evaluated based on its ability to predict housing prices accurately using evaluation metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and RÂ² score.

# Features
Geographical features: Latitude and Longitude of each district
Demographics: Median income, population density, and average household size
Housing data: Number of rooms, number of bedrooms, housing age, and more
Economic factors: Median house age, proximity to the coast, etc.

# Results & Future Work
This project aims to demonstrate the predictive power of machine learning models in real estate pricing. Future improvements could include:

Incorporating additional external data sources, such as interest rates or neighborhood crime rates.
Exploring more advanced models like deep learning or time-series forecasting for trend prediction.
